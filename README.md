# TravelBloom

## Overview

TravelBloom is a travel recommendation website that helps users discover amazing destinations. It allows users to search for places based on categories like countries, beaches, and temples, providing a curated list of options to inspire their next adventure.

## Functionality

*   **Search:** Users can enter keywords like "countries", "beaches", or "temples" to find relevant travel recommendations.
*   **Display:** Search results are displayed with images, names, and descriptions of the destinations.
*   **Navigation:** The website includes a navigation bar with links to the Home, About Us, and Contact Us pages.

## Architecture

The project follows a simple front-end architecture:

*   **HTML (travel\_recommendation.html):** Provides the structure of the website, including the navigation bar, search input, and search results container.
*   **CSS (travel\_recommendation.css):** Styles the website, including the layout, colors, and fonts.
*   **JavaScript (travel\_recommendation.js):** Handles the search functionality and dynamically displays the search results. It fetches data from the `travel_recommendation_api.json` file.
*   **JSON (travel\_recommendation\_api.json):** Contains the data for the travel recommendations, including countries, cities, beaches, and temples.
